# shorty
Shorty is a little tool, to help you create and manage global keystrokes. It will sit patiently in your systray and await your commands. You can also set up a webserver so shorty is able to receive commands per http request.

This app is based on electron, so it should run on most operating systems, but I'm actually having a hard time, to get it to run on linux right now and I haven't even started, to test it on OS X.

(This is still a work in progress, so don't expect too much of this little fella.)
